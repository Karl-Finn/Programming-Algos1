Gettysburg Address

This is an exercise in file analysis. Fundamentally it is an exercise in the use of the basic collection objects in
Python such as strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets.

We are going to use Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg address of 1863, This is famous for many things, including for being a
short speech.

TASKS

We are going to do some simple analysis on this.
1. Count the number of words in the speech. We will exclude from our analysis a number of 'stop words', in our example
these will be the definite and indefinite articles and some personal pronouns.
2. Count the unique words in the collection produced by 1 above.
3. Count the number of occurrences of each word.

Some hints
1. Import the string module. This gives string.whitespace, a string containing all of the whitespace characters
and string.punctuation, a string containing all of the punctuation characters.

2. Import the requests module. 

3. Sample code for resource retrieval

import requests
response = requests.get("http://example.org/")
headers = response.headers
body = response.content

Data

The files are on http://193.1.33.31:88/pa1/gettysburg.txt and http://193.1.33.31:88/pa1/stopwords.txt
